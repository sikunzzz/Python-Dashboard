I joined a quant competition recently and have 3months access to the financial database of Refinitiv. Before my access right expires, I want to utilize this data and build something related to the data I can get hold of.

This project is an exercise to apply package of dash and plotless to visualize data in dashboard in Python. Historical data and tick data for Henry Hub gas price. Data is collected from Refinitiv API using SQL query.

Historical data is available from 2016-11-01 to 2018-10-31, while tick history is available from 2018-10-01 to 2018-12-31.
